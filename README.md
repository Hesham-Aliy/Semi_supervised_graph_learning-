Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning method that falls between supervised and unsupervised learning. In Supervised learning, a model is trained on a labeled dataset, where the correct output is provided for each example in the training set. In Unsupervised learning, the model is not provided with labeled training examples, and must find patterns and relationships in the data on its own.

In semi-supervised learning, the model is trained on a dataset that is partially labeled. This means that only some of the examples in the training set have known, correct outputs. The model is then able to use this information, along with the patterns it finds in the unlabeled data, to make predictions on new examples.

# What Are Graph Neural Network?

Graph neural network is one of the most Deep learning hot topics nowadays that has many applications in real world; as the graphs are everywhere around us. Many types of data will be better is it represented in a graph data structure as graphs are not taking huge memory size as complex architectures as Convolution Neural Networks https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00596. 

In this Repo we reimplemented some of graph neural networks that working in a transductive way (Semi supervised).
